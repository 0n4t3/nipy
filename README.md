ni.py or "Nate's Inane Post Yeeter" is about as serious of a project as the name implies. It's a CLI Python client designed to post plain text messages simultaneously to Nostr relays of your choosing and a server that supports the Mastodon API. It's a work in progress so use it as such.

## Why?
I was bored.

Also maybe as a proof of concept or a slightly functional utility for me or others. What I'd love to see is a GUI client that can post to the two networks, have a following feed combining users on both protocols, and be able to reply to others (and see other's replies to me) on both protocols. I do not have the skills to build something like that, so I might as well build something I'm able to.

The project might also be handy. You can't use it to do anything in it beyond post, but it could be handy as a way to quickly share a thought or link from within the terminal. It also has has a cool retro feel and makes me think I'm a "l33t h4ck3r" because it's in the terminal.

## Dependencies
`pynostr` and `mastodon.py`

## Config

## To Do
* Definitely: store Nostr key and Activity Pub API key in encrypted form and prompt for a password when posting
* Maybe: Add addition protocols (e.g. AT)
* Maybe: Add a GUI option
* Pipe Dream: Add a tool that downloads the posts made by those who you follow over a specific time period (e.g. 24hrs) and export it to a text document for consumption
* Pipe Dream: Check for replies on your posts and be able to reply to other posts

## Updates
Add this repo's [RSS feed] to your favorite feed reader or [just about anything](https://followanything.dns7.top/). 

Or follow me on:
[Nostr](https://njump.me/npub1jy90jpcdl447ae3lp4924s65khdpvnttkg7fepmvmafycusyueksrvllx9) or [Friendica (AP Compatible)](https://nerdica.net/profile/nate0)

I also might setup a Nostr and Mastodon account for ni.py in the future to push out updates 'n stuff.

All the hard work was done for me. Credit to [PYNostr](https://github.com/holgern/pynostr) and [Mastodon.PY](https://github.com/halcy/Mastodon.py) for making this possible.
